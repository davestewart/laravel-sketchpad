# Laravel Sketchpad

## Introduction

Sketchpad is an innovative, bolt-on development environment for your existing Laravel site.

It's a place to write, test, experiment and execute code, or just a place to group useful tools and functions you want easy access to.

## Overview

Sketchpad provides an alternative structure of controllers, views, assets and routing that lives alongside your main Laravel installation.

You can navigate methods, interactively modify parameters, and even [live-reload](https://github.com/davestewart/laravel-sketchpad-reload) the code you're working on, all from a friendly UI.

Additional tooling and functionality is designed to make it quick and easy to develop or debug new tools, features and code.
